#Development Status

Open in Paw is still under development, doesn't have yet its complete features, and [Paw HTTP Client](http://luckymarmot.com/paw) is not yet adapted to handle the URL links that this extension opens.

When development will be finished, the "master" branch will only keep stable releases, for now "master" is used as a simple development branche.

Also, the Safari Extension will be built so you won't need to build it yourself :)

#Open in Paw
